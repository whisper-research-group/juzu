> a project for acoustic processing

We wrote some lines of code to automate the procedures in our experiments. <br>
Project descriptions will be added as they become available. <br><br>

This project uses [julius-speech/segmentation-kit](https://github.com/julius-speech/segmentation-kit "julius-speech/segmentation-kit") using [Julius](https://github.com/julius-speech/julius "Julius").
